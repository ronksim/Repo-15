# Repo-15
This repo is for the Projet Saburi-Konnect. 
We have built a system where the non-profits like Saburi Charitable Foundation can enter the details of the children we sponsor. This may include a picture, their personal details, their family background etc will have the ability to attach the receipts of the expenditure. This system is completely secure and is available only for admins and sponsors. Admin access is for the non-profits and they enter the details of the children. Sponsors can have the read access and only can view the details of the sponsored children.


Instructions:
============

1. Go to https://github.com/Opportunity-Hack-2015-SanJose/Repo-15#repo-15, grab the latest .zip file and unzip it. Take note of the destination of the folder.

2. Change directory to a folder destination ('cd folder_name').

3. Check if npm.js is installed on your machine ('npm'). If not installed, enter the command 'sudo npm install npm -g' followed by the admin password.

4. Check if mongodb.js is installed ('mongo'). If not installed, enter the command 'sudo npm install mongod -g' followed by the admin password.

5. Check if node.js is installed ('node'). If not installed, enter the command 'sudo npm install node -g' followed by the admin password.

6. Run the command 'npm install' to install the other javascript dependencies.

7. Finally, in terminal enter 'node server.js' to run the server. Terminal will display 'listening on port 8000'.

// Happy Hacking =) Ron!
